1)
Ensure that particle effects integrated with surface interactions are configured to only collide with ground surfaces, not the characters themselves.
(Particle Parent -> Collision -> Collides With)

2)
All effects are pre-set with the 'Cast Shadows' option turned off. This is to maintain consistent visuals across varying pipelines. 
However, depending on your requirements, you may choose to reactivate the shaddows for a more realistic look.
(Particle -> Renderer -> Cast Shaddows)
